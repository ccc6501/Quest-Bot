# Flow

## Recon → Modules
1) You drop recon (URL/text/map snippet)
2) AI outputs Recon Status Report:
   - good/bad assessment
   - modules created (primary/side/artifact)
   - % season readiness
   - gaps + recommended recon

## Modules → Quest
1) Inputs (time, weather, vibe, range, where, constraints)
2) Select modules with best fit + novelty + season theme
3) Compose quest:
   - 3–7 primary steps
   - 2–4 side steps
   - 2–5 artifacts (include False Signal)
4) Run quest → log memories → complete → pack

## Season Readiness
Track:
- core modules count
- side modules count
- coverage (vibe/time/weather/range)
- gaps (missing anchors/tones/connectors)
- readiness percentage + "recommended recon"
